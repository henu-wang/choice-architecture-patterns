# Choice Architecture Patterns

A comprehensive collection of design patterns for choice architecture and nudging. Choice architecture is the practice of designing the environment in which people make decisions to help them choose more effectively without restricting their freedom. This repository provides practical patterns, evidence-based techniques, and implementation guidelines for anyone designing decision environments.

## What is Choice Architecture?

Choice architecture, a term popularized by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, refers to the design of different ways in which choices can be presented to decision-makers and the impact of that presentation on their decisions. Every decision environment has an architecture, whether it was designed deliberately or emerged by default. The key insight is that no presentation of choices is neutral; the way options are arranged, described, and displayed inevitably influences which options people select.

Rather than assuming people will always make optimal choices regardless of context, choice architecture recognizes that human decision-making is heavily influenced by the decision environment. By designing that environment thoughtfully, we can help people make choices that better align with their own goals and preferences.

## Core Patterns

### Default Selection Pattern
Defaults are the most powerful tool in the choice architect's arsenal. When an option is pre-selected, the majority of people tend to accept it. This pattern leverages status quo bias and the effort required to make an active choice. Organ donation rates, retirement savings participation, and software privacy settings all demonstrate the enormous influence of defaults.

**When to use**: When there is a clearly beneficial option that most people would choose if they thought carefully about it, but inertia or complexity prevents active selection.

**Implementation guidelines**: Defaults should be set to the option that benefits the majority of users. They should be easy to change, and the existence of the default should be transparent.

### Simplification Pattern
Complexity is one of the greatest enemies of good decision-making. When choices are complicated, people either avoid making a decision entirely or resort to simplistic heuristics that may not serve them well. The simplification pattern involves reducing complexity by removing unnecessary options, breaking complex choices into smaller sequential decisions, and providing clear comparisons.

**When to use**: When decision-makers face options that are numerous, complex, or difficult to compare directly.

### Mapping Pattern
The mapping pattern helps people translate options into outcomes they can understand. When choosing among health insurance plans, for example, people struggle to evaluate deductibles, copays, and coverage limits. Mapping these abstract features into concrete scenarios, such as the total out-of-pocket cost for a broken arm or a chronic condition, makes the decision far more tractable.

**When to use**: When the attributes of options are abstract, technical, or difficult to relate to personal outcomes.

### Feedback Pattern
Effective feedback helps people understand the consequences of their choices in real time. Smart thermostats that show energy costs, credit card statements that show time-to-payoff at minimum payments, and calorie counts on restaurant menus all provide feedback that influences subsequent decisions.

**When to use**: When the consequences of choices are delayed, invisible, or difficult to connect to the original decision.

### Structuring Complex Choices Pattern
When people face many options, they need strategies for navigating the choice set efficiently. This pattern involves organizing options into categories, providing filtering and sorting tools, allowing progressive disclosure of detail, and offering curated recommendations based on stated preferences.

**When to use**: When the number of options exceeds what people can evaluate individually, typically more than five to seven alternatives.

### Social Proof Pattern
People look to the behavior of others when uncertain about what to do. Displaying what most people choose, showing ratings and reviews, and highlighting popular options all leverage social proof to guide decisions. This pattern can be used ethically to help people benefit from collective wisdom.

**When to use**: When decision-makers are uncertain and the choices of others provide genuinely informative signals about quality or suitability.

### Commitment Device Pattern
Commitment devices help people follow through on intentions they might otherwise abandon. They work by increasing the cost of deviating from a chosen course of action. Examples include automatic savings deductions, gym membership prepayments, and deadline commitments shared with accountability partners.

**When to use**: When people consistently fail to follow through on stated intentions due to present bias or temptation.

## Ethical Considerations

Choice architecture carries significant ethical responsibility. The line between a helpful nudge and manipulative design can be thin. Ethical choice architecture should increase transparency rather than reduce it, align with the decision-maker's own stated preferences, preserve freedom of choice, and be designed to benefit the decision-maker rather than the architect.

## Building Personal Choice Architecture

While much of the choice architecture literature focuses on institutional design, the same principles apply to personal decision environments. You can design your own choice architecture by setting beneficial defaults in your daily routines, structuring your environment to make good choices easier and bad choices harder, creating commitment devices for long-term goals, and building decision rules for recurring situations.

[KeepRule](https://keeprule.com) provides tools specifically designed for building personal choice architecture, helping you create structured decision frameworks that guide you toward better outcomes across all areas of life.

## Implementation Checklist

- Identify the decision you want to improve
- Understand the current default and how people are currently choosing
- Determine which pattern or combination of patterns best addresses the decision challenge
- Design the intervention with ethical guidelines in mind
- Test the architecture with a small group before full deployment
- Measure outcomes and iterate
